          <p>My interest in I.T started at quite at young age, I think when I got my first laptop in year 4 or 5 I had become obsessed with my laptop and everything I could possibly ever do with it.</p>

          <p> Another reason is that I live nearby the city. Because of this I won't have to pay for rent or live in university accommodation, it will be easier for me to support my studies financially also just generally save time in travel.</p>

For this class specially I expect to learn a wide arrange for things that is possible to do in the IT field. I hope that I can also learn the possible career pathways that are available in the field I am studying in how I can pursue and do my best in that profession. </p>
